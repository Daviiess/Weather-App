 🌤️ My Weather App

This is a simple weather app I built using *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It connects to the OpenWeatherMap API and lets you search for the current weather in any city. You get to see the temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed — all wrapped up in a clean and responsive UI.

I built this while learning JavaScript and practicing how to fetch data from APIs and update the DOM. I’m also using `localStorage` to remember the last city you searched, so when you reload the page, it fetches the weather for that city again automatically.
